                Other websites may set cookies while you browse our websites, usually if you're already logged into your
                accounts with them. These are often, but not always, social media accounts and part of the reason they
                use cookies is so that you can use the buttons on our website to share pages that interest you. These
                cookies also help us understand how people are using and interacting with our websites and we use this
                information to improve our websites and online advertising.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that we have no control over these third party cookies and pixels, and you should check the
                relevant third party websites for more information about these.

                What&apos;s a pixel
            </h4>
            <p>
                We also use pixels on our website, which are snippets of code that allow cookies to be downloaded to
                your device. These pixel tags identify a device as it browses different websites, partly so that
                targeted adverts can be shown to the user. We don't receive any identifiable data from pixels. If you
                disable cookies, your visit to salamander-explorers.netlify.app website will register as an anonymous
                visit.
