# Information for Future Editors

This is the live file system of the Poole North Scout Group website [pnsg.org.uk](https://pnsg.org.uk). To make updates to other areas of the website please consult the Online Systems User Guide (Part 1).

## Updating Files

### Editing Files

To make edits to the files here, first download, clone or open the file system using the green 'code' button located to the top left of the repository viewer. Files can be edited using a code editor, historically this has been Microsoft Visual Studio Code. Once changes have been made, the repository files can be updates by committing to the repository.

### Committing Edits

Edits can then be 'pushed' to the repository by making a commit, this can be done by using the grey 'add file' button next to the green 'code' button. Select the 'upload files' option and upload all of the downloaded files in uncompressed form (e.g. outside of a zip file).

## Branches

The website is located in the `main` branch whilst each section has its own branch, select the desired branch before downloading and committing files.

## Other Operations

There are many different ways to update this file system and a skilled website editor will use their preferred method. There is a wide range of information available directly from [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/) and from elsewhere on the internet for how to perform other operations.
